This kind of model is useful for insurance companies to determine the yearly insurance premium for a person. The dataset for this problem is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance\n\n\nWe will create a model with the following steps:\n1. Download and explore the dataset\n2. Prepare the dataset for training\n3. Create a linear regression model\n4. Train the model to fit the data\n5. Make predictions using the trained model\n\n\nThis assignment builds upon the concepts from the first 2 lectures. It will help to review these Jupyter notebooks:\n- PyTorch basics: https://jovian.ml/aakashns/01-pytorch-basics\n- Linear Regression: https://jovian.ml/aakashns/02-linear-regression\n- Logistic Regression: https://jovian.ml/aakashns/03-logistic-regression\n- Linear regression (minimal): https://jovian.ml/aakashns/housing-linear-minimal\n- Logistic regression (minimal): https://jovian.ml/aakashns/mnist-logistic-minimal\n\nAs you go through this notebook, you will find a **???** in certain places. Your job is to replace the **???** with appropriate code or values, to ensure that the notebook runs properly end-to-end . In some cases, you'll be required to choose some hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size etc.). Try to experiment with the hypeparameters to get the lowest loss.\n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":80,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done\n","Solving environment: done\n","\n","\n","==> WARNING: A newer version of conda exists. <==\n","  current version: 4.8.2\n","  latest version: 4.8.3\n","\n","Please update conda by running\n","\n","    $ conda update -n base conda\n","\n","\n","\n","# All requested packages already installed.\n","\n","Requirement already satisfied: pandas in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (1.0.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.6.1 in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas) (2.8.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.13.3 in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas) (1.18.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pytz>=2017.2 in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas) (2020.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.6.1->pandas) (1.15.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: seaborn in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (0.10.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.13.3 in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from seaborn) (1.18.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: matplotlib>=2.1.2 in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from seaborn) (3.2.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pandas>=0.22.0 in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from seaborn) (1.0.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: scipy>=1.0.1 in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from seaborn) (1.4.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: kiwisolver>=1.0.1 in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from matplotlib>=2.1.2->seaborn) (1.2.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: cycler>=0.10 in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from matplotlib>=2.1.2->seaborn) (0.10.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.1 in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from matplotlib>=2.1.2->seaborn) (2.8.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pyparsing!=2.0.4,!=2.1.2,!=2.1.6,>=2.0.1 in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from matplotlib>=2.1.2->seaborn) (2.4.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pytz>=2017.2 in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas>=0.22.0->seaborn) (2020.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six in /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from cycler>=0.10->matplotlib>=2.1.2->seaborn) (1.15.0)\n"]}],"source":"# Uncomment and run the commands below if imports fail\n!conda install numpy pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch -y\n!pip install matplotlib --upgrade --quiet\n!pip install jovian --upgrade --quiet\n!pip install pandas\n!pip install seaborn"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":81,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"\nimport torch\nimport jovian\nimport torchvision\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torchvision.datasets.utils import download_url\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset, random_split"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":82,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"project_name='02-insurance-linear-regression' # will be used by jovian.commit"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## Step 1: Download and explore the data\n\nLet us begin by downloading the data.
